- Change Handlers to say "handleSomeTask" instead of "onSomeTaskHandler"
  - Only use above if you can't turn the function into something like "changeList"
- Implement search
  - Display search box and the results below it. Search box filters results below by regex
  - Results are links. Up or Down arrow will focus results.
    - Well need to add some features to the list like stepping back or forward in a loop.
      - pass next() and back() in HOF, if none are called then stop traversal.
      - if next() hits the end, it returns undefined.
      - if next() is called again, it terminates traversal.
  - Give titles anchor points
    - That's why it's a good idea to leave title scroll sticking to js
+ Implement order in Collection
- Move SaveEntries to entries
- Turn Collections to class
